I see museums as places with which art, technology, and nature are shared, and as such there has been a significant human component in each of those aspects. Often, human guides around these places have a personal interest in what they are showing and result in a much more enriched environment while learned about the artefacts contained inside. While I just don’t believe a robot would be able to replicate the experience, I do not deny the advantage of the robot being able to retain a far greater amount of information about the topics being shown. Of the three categories I listed above, I believe they would be most suited in nature based museums, like astrology centres or something like a dinosaur exhibit, with drastically decreasing approval in technological and especially art based museums. ","Currently, general clumsiness is my largest concern, however being very situationally aware I do not believe it would affect me personally.
